                    <p>The Myanmar Medical Council, with its inherent powers established under the Medical Act 1971, is responsible for recognising medical schools for the purpose of licensing their graduates for practice in Myanmar pursuant to section 12(2) as follows:</p>
                    <p>Under the statute, fresh graduates need to undergo a period of internship training of not less than a year. Upon full registration, they are compelled by law to serve a period of not less than three years within public health services. For that purpose, the law only allows graduates from recognised medical training institutions for registration. Graduates from non-recognised medical schools, on the other hand, need to sit and pass medical qualifying examination to be eligible for registration.</p>
